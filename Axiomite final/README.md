This is the source code for Axiomite, our website for finding slogans for 
less popular days, such as Women's Day, Earth day etc. 

You can search for a particular day with a particular keyword or "sentiment", 
and the IBM Bluemix "Retrieve and Rank" API will give relevant slogan back.

Note that the API needs to be trained extensively for this to work.
Uses HTML, Bootstrap and canvas to render the web page and t-shirt editing module.
